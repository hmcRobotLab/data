depth 3" at the widest part (the base)

The Kinect head (the rectangular part) is 11? x 2.5? x 1.5? (w x d x h). The base is 3? x 3? x 1.5? (w x d x h). The cable sticks out the back of the base, so you need more than 3 inches of room. So total height is around 3 inches…will need a little more room because the head tilts on its own and might need space.
